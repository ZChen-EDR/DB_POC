//right now the value and name of the parameter used to form a policy are added seperately
//so user had to select potential values from all possible values first before they can select one in the policy
//for example, there 8 possible values for "LoanType", user has to first select several values(3 let's say in this case) out of the 8, and pick one from the 3 when forming the final policy


//Should be
//let user add a parameter and pick the value out of all possible values.


//when you delete a value, all rows in the matrix that has that value should be affected
//should be relational
//no way to change the value
